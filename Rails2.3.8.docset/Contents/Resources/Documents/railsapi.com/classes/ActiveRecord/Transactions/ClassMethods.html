<a href="../Transactions.html">Transactions</a> are protective blocks where
SQL statements are only permanent if they can all succeed as one atomic
action. The classic example is a transfer between two accounts where you
can only have a deposit if the withdrawal succeeded and vice versa. <a
href="../Transactions.html">Transactions</a> enforce the integrity of the
database and guard the data against program errors or database break-downs.
So basically you should use transaction blocks whenever you have a number
of statements that must be executed together or not at all. Example:
</p>
<pre>
  ActiveRecord::Base.transaction do
    david.withdrawal(100)
    mary.deposit(100)
  end
</pre>
<p>
This example will only take money from David and give to Mary if neither
<tt>withdrawal</tt> nor <tt>deposit</tt> raises an exception. Exceptions
will force a ROLLBACK that returns the database to the state before the
transaction was begun. Be aware, though, that the objects will <em>not</em>
have their instance data returned to their pre-transactional state.
</p>
<h2>Different Active Record classes in a single transaction</h2>
<p>
Though the transaction class method is called on some Active Record class,
the objects within the transaction block need not all be instances of that
class. This is because transactions are per-database connection, not
per-model.
</p>
<p>
In this example a <tt>Balance</tt> record is transactionally saved even
though <tt>transaction</tt> is called on the <tt>Account</tt> class:
</p>
<pre>
  Account.transaction do
    balance.save!
    account.save!
  end
</pre>
<p>
Note that the <tt>transaction</tt> method is also available as a model
instance method. For example, you can also do this:
</p>
<pre>
  balance.transaction do
    balance.save!
    account.save!
  end
</pre>
<h2><a href="../Transactions.html">Transactions</a> are not distributed across database connections</h2>
<p>
A transaction acts on a single database connection. If you have multiple
class-specific databases, the transaction will not protect interaction
among them. One workaround is to begin a transaction on each class whose
models you alter:
</p>
<pre>
  Student.transaction do
    Course.transaction do
      course.enroll(student)
      student.units += course.units
    end
  end
</pre>
<p>
This is a poor solution, but full distributed transactions are beyond the
scope of Active Record.
</p>
<h2>Save and destroy are automatically wrapped in a transaction</h2>
<p>
Both <a href="../Base.html#M001108">Base#save</a> and <a
href="../Base.html#M000972">Base#destroy</a> come wrapped in a transaction
that ensures that whatever you do in validations or callbacks will happen
under the protected cover of a transaction. So you can use validations to
check for values that the transaction depends on or you can raise
exceptions in the callbacks to rollback, including <tt>after_*</tt>
callbacks.
</p>
<h2>Exception handling and rolling back</h2>
<p>
Also have in mind that exceptions thrown within a transaction block will be
propagated (after triggering the ROLLBACK), so you should be ready to catch
those in your application code.
</p>
<p>
One exception is the <a href="../Rollback.html">ActiveRecord::Rollback</a>
exception, which will trigger a ROLLBACK when raised, but not be re-raised
by the transaction block.
</p>
<p>
<b>Warning</b>: one should not catch <a
href="../StatementInvalid.html">ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid</a>
exceptions inside a transaction block. <a
href="../StatementInvalid.html">StatementInvalid</a> exceptions indicate
that an error occurred at the database level, for example when a unique
constraint is violated. On some database systems, such as PostgreSQL,
database errors inside a transaction causes the entire transaction to
become unusable until it&#8217;s restarted from the beginning. Here is an
example which demonstrates the problem:
</p>
<pre>
  # Suppose that we have a Number model with a unique column called 'i'.
  Number.transaction do
    Number.create(:i =&gt; 0)
    begin
      # This will raise a unique constraint error...
      Number.create(:i =&gt; 0)
    rescue ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid
      # ...which we ignore.
    end

    # On PostgreSQL, the transaction is now unusable. The following
    # statement will cause a PostgreSQL error, even though the unique
    # constraint is no longer violated:
    Number.create(:i =&gt; 1)
    # =&gt; &quot;PGError: ERROR:  current transaction is aborted, commands
    #     ignored until end of transaction block&quot;
  end
</pre>
<p>
One should restart the entire transaction if a StatementError occurred.
</p>
<h2>Nested transactions</h2>
<p>
<a href="ClassMethods.html#M000822">transaction</a> calls can be nested. By
default, this makes all database statements in the nested transaction block
become part of the parent transaction. For example:
</p>
<pre>
  User.transaction do
    User.create(:username =&gt; 'Kotori')
    User.transaction do
      User.create(:username =&gt; 'Nemu')
      raise ActiveRecord::Rollback
    end
  end

  User.find(:all)  # =&gt; empty
</pre>
<p>
It is also possible to requires a sub-transaction by passing
<tt>:requires_new =&gt; true</tt>. If anything goes wrong, the database
rolls back to the beginning of the sub-transaction without rolling back the
parent transaction. For example:
</p>
<pre>
  User.transaction do
    User.create(:username =&gt; 'Kotori')
    User.transaction(:requires_new =&gt; true) do
      User.create(:username =&gt; 'Nemu')
      raise ActiveRecord::Rollback
    end
  end

  User.find(:all)  # =&gt; Returns only Kotori
</pre>
<p>
Most databases don&#8217;t support true nested transactions. At the time of
writing, the only database that we&#8217;re aware of that supports true
nested transactions, is MS-SQL. Because of this, Active Record emulates
nested transactions by using savepoints. See <a
href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/savepoints.html">dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/savepoints.html</a>
for more information about savepoints.
</p>
<h3>Caveats</h3>
<p>
If you&#8217;re on MySQL, then do not use DDL operations in nested
transactions blocks that are emulated with savepoints. That is, do not
execute statements like &#8216;CREATE TABLE&#8217; inside such blocks. This
is because MySQL automatically releases all savepoints upon executing a DDL
operation. When <a href="ClassMethods.html#M000822">transaction</a> is
finished and tries to release the savepoint it created earlier, a database
error will occur because the savepoint has already been automatically
released. The following example demonstrates the problem:
</p>
<pre>
  Model.connection.transaction do                           # BEGIN
    Model.connection.transaction(:requires_new =&gt; true) do  # CREATE SAVEPOINT active_record_1
      Model.connection.create_table(...)                    # active_record_1 now automatically released
    end                                                     # RELEASE savepoint active_record_1
                                                            # ^^^^ BOOM! database error!
  end
</pre>
